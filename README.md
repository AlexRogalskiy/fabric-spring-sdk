# Spring Data for Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode

The primary goal of the [Spring Data](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data) project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

The Spring Data for Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode project aims to provide a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model to access functionality of Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode while retaining chaincode (smart contracts) features and capabilities. The Spring Data for Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode project provides integration with the Hyperledger Fabric. Key functional areas of Spring Data for Hyperledger Fabric Chaincode is chaincode invocation abstraction, HYperledger Fabric connectivity simplification and easily writing a repository style chaincode access layer.
